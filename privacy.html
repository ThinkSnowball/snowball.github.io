Please refrain from sharing your password with anyone.</p>

<h2 id="2trackingtechnologiesonourwebsite"><strong>2. Tracking Technologies on our Website</strong></h2>
<h3 id="googleanalytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service enabling us to collect and analyze data concerning visitor behavior on our website. This service utilizes cookies to facilitate the analysis of website usage, processing personal data such as online identifiers (including cookie identifiers), IP addresses, device identifiers, and information regarding interactions with our website.</p>
<p>Some of this data is stored on your device, and additional information may be stored via cookies. Access to or storage of this information by Google Analytics occurs only with your consent.</p>
<p>The personal data processed through Google Analytics may be transferred to any country where Google Ireland or its subprocessors maintain facilities. Please refer to the "Data Transfer to Third Countries" section for further details.</p>
<p>In addition to opting out of Google Analytics via our Consent Banner, you can prevent the collection of data generated by cookies related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and its processing by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>
<p>We exclusively use Google Analytics with IP anonymization activated, ensuring that Google truncates IP addresses within member states of the European Union or other countries participating in the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the complete IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there. The IP address transmitted by your browser will not be merged with other Google data.</p>
<p>For more information about Google's privacy practices, please visit the following link: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>We utilize Google Analytics 4, enabling us to track interaction data across different devices and sessions. This capability allows us to contextualize individual user actions and analyze long-term relationships. User action data is retained for 14 months and is automatically deleted thereafter. All other event data is stored for 2 months before automatic deletion occurs on a monthly basis.</p>
<h3 id="googleads">Google Ads</h3>
<p>We employ Google Ads, an online advertising program provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google"), on our website. Through Google Ads, we display advertisements on the Google search engine. When you access our website via a Google ad, Google sets a cookie on your device ("conversion cookie"). Each Google Ads customer receives a unique conversion cookie, preventing tracking across different Ads customer websites. The information gathered through these cookies is used to compile conversion statistics, indicating the total number of users who clicked on our Google ads. However, no personally identifiable information is provided to us. Please note that your data may be transferred to the United States during this process. For more information on data transfers to third countries, please refer to the relevant section.</p>
